1. **(2 points)** From the list select all valid names for declaring variables:
   1. x
   2. main
   3. 1a
   4. e2e3
   5. int
   6. x--y

2. **(1 point)** Convert from binary to decimal representation: 101100111

3. **(1 point)** Convert from decimal to binary representation: 123

4. **(4 points)** Let's call a number "monotonous" if it consists of at most two
unique digits.

From standard input read three digit number and in standard output print
"YES" if number is monotonous and "NO" otherwise.
Make sure you print answer in all upper case.

| Sample input | Corresponding output |
|--------------|----------------------|
| 121          | YES                  |
| 333          | YES                  |
| 437          | NO                   |

5. **(4 points)** Given a four digit number find maximum number you can get by
placing exactly one multiplication sign in between its digits.

From standard input read four digit number and in standard output print maximum
possible answer.

| Sample input | Corresponding output |
|--------------|----------------------|
| 4512         | 2048                 |
| 1234         | 492                  |
