4. **(4 points)** Nick only owns red and blue socks. Every day he wears new pair
and does not reuse them until the next wash cycle. He always prioritizes wearing
different colored ones if possible. Given number of red and blue socks Nick owns

Nick owns respectively. And in standard output print maximum number of days he
can avoid washing.
